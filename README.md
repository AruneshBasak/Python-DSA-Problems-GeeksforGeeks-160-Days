# Python-DSA-Problems-GeeksforGeeks-160-Days

A 160-day journey of solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) using **Python**.  
This repository documents my daily practice, problem-solving approach, and solutions in Python to strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
